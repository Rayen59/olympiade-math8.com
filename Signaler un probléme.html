        <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
        <p>
            1) Individual Work: Encourage users to work individually on the proposed problems. This promotes personal reflection and independent problem-solving in mathematics.
            2) Individual Writing: Ask users to write their solutions and responses individually. This ensures the originality and authenticity of submitted work.
            3) Anti-Fraud Policy: Clearly inform users that any form of cheating, including copying or plagiarism, is strictly prohibited and will result in disciplinary measures.
            4) Sanctions for Fraud: Specify that anyone caught cheating will be subject to sanctions. For example, access to the math olympiad site may be temporarily or permanently blocked, depending on the severity of the offense.
            5) Duration of Block: Indicate that the duration of the block will be determined by the site administrator, based on the nature of the fraud committed. This may vary for first-time offenses, but harsher measures may be taken for repeat offenses.
            6) User Responsibility: Emphasize the importance for each user to uphold academic integrity and site rules. Encourage them to report any suspicious activity or rule violations.
            7) Education and Awareness: Provide educational resources on academic ethics and the importance of integrity in mathematical competitions. This may include tips on recognizing and avoiding fraud.
            ðŸ˜Ž To succeed in the Olympiads, it is crucial to understand the requirements and prepare effectively. First and foremost, manage your time wisely: with only 4 and a half hours to solve 6 problems, every minute counts. Prioritize problems based on their complexity and focus on those you can solve most quickly. Be sure to read the instructions carefully and follow the guidelines for each problem to avoid costly errors. Additionally, accuracy is paramount: submit your solutions only when you are confident in their correctness, as submissions after the deadline will be rejected. Also, avoid any form of plagiarism: organizers and graders are vigilant and have means to detect similarities between submissions. Finally, stay calm and focused throughout the competition, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges. Remember that each problem is an opportunity for learning and growth, and your perseverance can make the difference between success and defeat.
