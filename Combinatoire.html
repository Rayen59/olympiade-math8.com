                Seven dwarfs are sitting around a round table. Each has a glass in front of him. Some glasses contain milk, totaling 3 liters altogether. One of the dwarfs evenly shares his milk with the other six without keeping any for himself. Moving clockwise around the table, each subsequent dwarf does the same. After the seventh dwarf has shared his milk, the contents of the glasses are the same as initially. Determine how much milk each dwarf originally had.

                \( n \) football teams participate in a tournament where each team plays against every other team exactly once. The winner of each match gets three points, the loser gets 0 points, and both teams get one point each in case of a draw.

                A math competition consists of 30 multiple-choice questions. The score \( s \) of a participant is calculated by the formula: \( s = 30 + 4c - m \) where \( c \) is the number of correct answers and \( m \) is the number of incorrect answers. Participants are not penalized for unanswered questions. Lisa informed Christian that her score, which was over 80, allowed him to determine the number of questions she answered correctly. If Lisa's score had been lower but still over 80, Christian would not have been able to determine it. What was Lisa's score?

                    <li>Type 1: Choose a non-empty box \( B_j \) with \( 1 \leq j \leq 5 \); remove one token from box \( B_j \) and add two tokens to box \( B_{j+1} \).</li>
                    <li>Type 2: Choose a non-empty box \( B_k \) with \( 1 \leq k \leq 4 \); remove one token from box \( B_k \) and swap the contents (potentially empty) of boxes \( B_{k+1} \) and \( B_{k+2} \).</li>
